# round_robin
Implementation of a Round Robin algorithm for a process scheduler

This is a basic implementation of a process scheduler using a round robin.

Exists a file called "procsched.txt" that defines the processes that will be loaded.

Each line defines one process. The first argument (an integer is mandatory) defines the time in seconds that each process will be executed for each round. Once the time is consumed, the process will be queued.
